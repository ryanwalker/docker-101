# docker-101
Let's learn some Docker!

# Pre-requisite: Docker Installation

All platforms can install Docker using Vagrant and Virtual Box. This is probably the best way to go for beginners.

1. Install vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
2. Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org
3. Clone this repo - `git clone git@github.com:ryanwalker/docker-101.git`
4. `cd docker-101`
5. `docker run hello-world`  

Linux users can install docker natively if you so choose.

# Installation Verification
Run the command `docker run hello-world` or `sudo docker run hello-world`.
If all is well you'll see 'Hello from Docker' along with a description of what just happened.
