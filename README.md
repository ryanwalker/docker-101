# Docker-101

## Pre-Requisites

### Docker Installation

#### Linux, Mac, Windows Installation (Recommended)
Linux, Mac and Windows can install Docker using Vagrant and Virtual Box. This is probably the best way to go for this talk.

1. Install vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
2. Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org
3. Clone this repo - `git clone git@github.com:ryanwalker/docker-101.git`
4. `cd docker-101`
5. `docker run hello-world` - you should see 'Hello from Docker' along with information on what docker just did.  

#### Optional for Linux users - May be more involved depending on kernel version
Linux users can install docker natively if you so choose.

1. https://docs.docker.com/installation/
2. `docker run hello-world` - you should see 'Hello from Docker' along with information on what docker just did.

### Pull Docker Images
